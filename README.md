## Goals

The goals of this project are:

* Build a two hidden layers neural network and supporting functions for training from scratch.
    * `NNfromScratch.py`

* Have a unit testing file to make sure all the neural network code is working as expected.
    * `NNfromScratch_test.py`

* Build a small neural network from scratch with NumPy.
    * `01 -- Digits MNIST - NumPy.ipynb`

* Achieve 99%+ accuracy on the small neural network from scratch with SciPyâ€™s optimization.
    * `02 -- Digits MNIST - SciPy.ipynb`

* Implement a similar network from scratch with the TensorFlow framework.
    * `03 -- Digits MNIST - TensorFlow.ipynb`

* Implement a similar network with the Keras framework and then tune the hyper parameters for better accuracy.
    * `04 -- Digits MNIST - Keras.ipynb`

* Implement a more complex network using the Neural Network from Scratch library to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset.
    * `In progress...`


## Installation

To create a new virtual environment with Anaconda and the `requirements.txt` file:

    $ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
